# Lost in Translation... Strings
## i18n for Angular Applications

## ü§î The Background

What does i18n stand for and why is there an "18" in the middle? Even as a front-end engineer I had no idea until I looked it up. It's the number of letters between "i" and "n" in the word "internationalization." So, i18n is internationalization. Pretty neat. One of the [definitions](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n) of i18n is:

> The design and development of a product, application or document content that **enables** easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.

By following the i18n definition link above, we can see that there are multiple areas of development that i18n touches on. However, the area we'll concentrate on in this article is:

> Separating localizable elements from source code or content, such that localized alternatives can be loaded or selected based on the user's international preferences as needed.

In essence, whatever should be displayed in different languages needs to be separated out from the meat of the code to enable its maintainability.

In the article, we will explore how to implement our translation strings in a maintainable manner, enable the application to load only necessary resources, and allow browser memorization of the selected language. Then we will enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and solve issues encountered during enabling SSR in the Angular application.

The article is split up in the following parts:
Part 1. Setting the Scene
Part 2. Adding SSR to the¬†App
Part 3. Solution 1 - Fix via Providing a Separate I18nModule for the¬†Server
Part 4. Solution 2 - Provide Everything in a Single¬†Module
Part 5. Improve Performance with TransferState
Part 6. Are We There¬†Yet?

In the first part of this article, we will follow simple instructions for setting up an Angular application and adding i18n capabilities to it. Beginner-level developers may want to take a deep dive into the Part 1. More advanced developers may glance at the code in the following sections and proceed to the "Part 2. Adding SSR to the¬†App" to find out what obstacles adding SSR will create and how to solve them.

## üìù # Part 1 of 6 - Setting the Scene

For the purposes of this article, we'll work with a bare-bones Angular application generated with [AngularCLI](https://cli.angular.io/). To follow along with the article, we will generate an app using the command (assuming the Angular CLI installed globally):

```
ng new ssr-with-i18n
```

For the sake of the example let's add a couple of components:
```
ng g c comp-a
ng g c comp-b
```

Now, we will replace the contents of app.component.html with these two components:

```html
<h1>Welcome to {{ title }}!</h1>
<app-comp-a></app-comp-a>
<app-comp-b></app-comp-b>
```

*** The code up to this point is available [here](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko/ssr-with-i18n/tree/step-1-a).

## üó∫Ô∏è Let's Add i18n

As with most things in coding, there are many ways to skin a cat. Originally, I wanted to use the framework-independent library [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with an Angular wrapper: [angular-i18next](https://github.com/Romanchuk/angular-i18next). However, there is currently a [unfortunate limitation](https://github.com/Romanchuk/angular-i18next/pull/11#issuecomment-364725022) with angular-i18next: it's not capable of switching language on the fly, which is a show-stopper for me.

In this article, we'll use a popular library: [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). 

Using ngx-translate will allow us to store our strings in separate JSON files (a file per language) where each string will be represented by a key-value pair. The key is a string identifier and the value is the translation of the string.

1. Install Dependencies

In addition to the core library, we'll install the http-loader library which will enable loading translations on-demand.

```
npm install @ngx-translate/core @ngx-translate/http-loader --save
```

2. Add the Code

The directions for the ngx-translate package suggest adding relevant code directly to the AppModule. However, I think we can do better. Let's create a separate module that will encapsulate i18n related logic.

```
ng g m i18n --module app
```

This will add a new file: `/i18n/i18n.module.ts` and reference it in the `app.module.ts`.

Modify the `i18n.module.ts` file according to the [documentation](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core#configuration). The full code file is below.

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { TranslateLoader, TranslateModule, TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core';
import { TranslateHttpLoader } from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    HttpClientModule,
    TranslateModule.forRoot({
      loader: {
        provide: TranslateLoader,
        useFactory: translateLoaderFactory,
        deps: [HttpClient]
      }
    }),
  ],
  exports: [TranslateModule]
})
export class I18nModule {
  constructor(translate: TranslateService) {
    translate.addLangs(['en', 'ru']);
    const browserLang = translate.getBrowserLang();
    translate.use(browserLang.match(/en|ru/) ? browserLang : 'en');
  }
}

export function translateLoaderFactory(httpClient: HttpClient) {
  return new TranslateHttpLoader(httpClient);
}
```

Nothing fancy is going on. We just added the `TranslateModule` and configured it to use the `HttpClient` to load translations. We exported `TranslateModule` as well to make the pipe `transform` available in the `AppModule` and in HTML templates. In the constructor, we specified available languages and used a function provided by ngx-transltate to get and use the browser's default language.

By default, the `TranslateHttpLoader` will load translations from the `/assets/i18n/` folder, so let's add a couple of files there.

**/assets/i18n/en.json**
```json
{
  "compA": "Component A works",
  "compB": "Component B works"
}
```
/assets/i18n/ru.json
```json
{
  "compA": "–ö–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç –ê —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç",
  "compB": "–ö–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç –ë —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç"
}
```

Note: we are using a single file per language. In more complex applications there's nothing limiting us from creating files based on locale, e.g. `en-US.json`, `en-GB.json`. These will be treated essentially as separate translations.

With this configuration, we should be able to update our component templates to use the translation strings instead of hard-coded text.

```html
// comp-a.component.html
<p>{{'compA' | translate}}</p>

// comp-b.component.html
<p>{{'compB' | translate}}</p>
```

Run the application and notice that it's using the translations from the `en.json` file. Let's add a component that will let us switch between the two languages.

```
ng g c select-language --inlineStyle --inlineTemplate
```

Update the contents of the select-language.component.ts file.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-select-language',
  template: `
    <select #langSelect (change)="translate.use(langSelect.value)">
      <option
        *ngFor="let lang of translate.getLangs()"
        [value]="lang"
        [attr.selected]="lang === translate.currentLang ? '' : null"
      >{{lang}}</option>
    </select>
  `,
})
export class SelectLanguageComponent {
  constructor(public translate: TranslateService) { }
}
```

The ngx-translate library allows us to switch languages via a simple `translate.use()` API call. It also allows us to determine the currently selected language by querying the `translate.currentLang` property.

Insert the new component in the `app.component.html` file after the `h1` tag.

```html
<h1>Welcome to {{ title }}!</h1>
<app-select-language></app-select-language>
<app-comp-a></app-comp-a>
<app-comp-b></app-comp-b>
```

Run the application and see that the language can now be switched on the fly. Selecting a different language will request the appropriate¬†`.json` file.

Now, if we select the language `ru` and refresh the browser, we'll see that the page still loads with the language `en` selected. The browser does not have a mechanism for remembering the selected language. Let's fix that.

## üôÑ Memorizing the Selected¬†Language

The Angular community has made many [plugins](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core#plugins) enhancing the functionality of the ngx-translate package. One of them is exactly what we need‚Ää-‚Ää[ngx-translate-cache](https://github.com/jgpacheco/ngx-translate-cache). By following instructions, we'll (1) install the package

```
npm install ngx-translate-cache --save
```

and (2) use it inside of the I18nModule.

```ts
import { TranslateCacheModule, TranslateCacheSettings, TranslateCacheService } from 'ngx-translate-cache';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    TranslateModule.forRoot(...), // unchanged
    TranslateCacheModule.forRoot({
      cacheService: {
        provide: TranslateCacheService,
        useFactory: translateCacheFactory,
        deps: [TranslateService, TranslateCacheSettings]
      },
      cacheMechanism: 'Cookie'
    })
  ]
})
export class I18nModule {
  constructor(
    translate: TranslateService,
    translateCacheService: TranslateCacheService
  ) {
    translateCacheService.init();
    translate.addLangs(['en', 'ru']);
    const browserLang = translateCacheService.getCachedLanguage() || translate.getBrowserLang();
    translate.use(browserLang.match(/en|ru/) ? browserLang : 'en');
  }
}

export function translateCacheFactory(
  translateService: TranslateService,
  translateCacheSettings: TranslateCacheSettings
) {
  return new TranslateCacheService(translateService, translateCacheSettings);
}
```

Now, if we select the language `ru` and refresh the browser we'll see that it remembered our choice. Notice, that we selected `'Cookie'` as a place to store the selected language. The default selection for this option is `'LocalStorage'`. However, LocalStorage is not accessible on the server. A big part of this article has to do with enabling SSR, so we're being a little bit proactive here and storing the language selection in the place where a server can read it.

Up until now there really was nothing special about this article. We simply followed instructions posted in relevant packages and encapsulated the i18n related logic in a separate module. Adding SSR has some tricky parts, so let's take a closer look.
